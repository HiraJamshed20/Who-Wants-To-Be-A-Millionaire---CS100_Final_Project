 Arguments: it takes a boolean variable which is a reference parameter and uses it as a check (whether the user has entered a number or not)*/

/* This function prints out the pyramid that shows the status of the user in the game, increasing in level after every correct question.. much like
 climbing a ladder
 Arguments: ques_count keeps track of what question the user is on, array money level consists of the amounts corresponding to each question and size
 defines the size of the array*/

/*deals with the lifelines
 Arguments: ques_count keeps track of the question user is on. The strings are the choices that are displayed in the question. The array ans_array
 contains the answers to every question (corresponding to the ques_count) and SIZE defines the size of the array. The array money_level consists of
 the money corresponding to each question (connected by ques_count) and size defines the size of this array. The boolean variables ll1, ll2 and ll3
 keep track of whether the corresponding lifline has been used. Version keeps count of what version the user is currently on for the second lifeline
 function.*/

 Arguments: choice stores the answer of the user, ques_count keeps track of what the user is on, the array money_level consists of
 the money corresponding to each question (connected by ques_count) and size defines the size of this array and the array ans_array
 contains the answers to every question (corresponding to the ques_count) and SIZE defines the size of the array.*/

 ll3 keep track of whether the corresponding lifline has been used.The array ans_array contains the answers to every question (corresponding to the
 ques_count) and SIZE defines the size of the array. Version keeps count of te version the user is on.

 them to the functions called in it (lifelines and corr_or_incorr)*/
